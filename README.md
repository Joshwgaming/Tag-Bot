# Tag-Bot
Simple bot to create custom tags, similar to the dyno bot feature.

This bot was designed for a project that fell through so dediced to publish it onto github, if i get round to it i'll update it to slash commands or whatever.

This bot requires a functional discord bot, and a mongodb server to store the commands/command info.

### Features:
- Each user can create up to 10 custom tags.
- Duplicate tags cannot be created, an error will be displayed
- Users can define if they want to set an embed colour with their tag, if none if specified the default colour of black will be displayed
